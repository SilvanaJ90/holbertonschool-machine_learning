## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General

    What is Neural Style Transfer?
    What is a gram matrix?
    How to calculate style cost
    How to calculate content cost
    What is Gradient Tape and how do you use it?
    How to perform Neural Style Transfer

## Requirements
General

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8)
    Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.19.2) and tensorflow (version 2.6)
    All your files should end with a new line
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.6.0)
    All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
    All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
    All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
    Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module except import numpy as np and import tensorflow as tf
    All your files must be executable
